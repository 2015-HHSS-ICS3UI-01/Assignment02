2. These two statements behave the same but are coded differently
because every line of code is the opposite of the other. For example in 
statement one, the code was written to say if karel can pick up  the thing then 
he will turn right or if he can't pick up the thing than he will turn left. 
Whereas in statement two, the code was written to say if karel can't pick up 
thing than he will turn left or if he can pick up the thing than he will turn 
left. Therefore the robot will operate in the same way.
